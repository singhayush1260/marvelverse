              This app is a personal project built using React Native to
              practice mobile development. Iâ€™ve used the Marvel API to bring you
              the fascinating world of Marvel Comics. This app is focused on the
              comics universe, not the cinematic one, as Marvel doesn't provide
              a cinematic API. It offers detailed information about your
              favorite characters, comics, creators, and more! While I didn't
              include a search option due to API limitations, you can explore a
              wide range of Marvel's iconic characters and stories!
